📖 Introduction

This project aims to help banks and financial institutions identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain these customers. The model not only predicts churn but also provides detailed explanations of the factors influencing each prediction, enhancing interpretability and actionability.
✨ Features

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Efficient data cleaning, encoding, and feature transformation to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Model: A robust classification model trained to predict churn with a high level of accuracy.
Interpretability Function: A custom function that explains each churn prediction in a narrative format, making it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identification of the top features driving the churn predictions.
Statistical Insights: Summary statistics for churned customers to provide a comprehensive understanding of churn behavior.
🛠 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, pickle, matplotlib
Machine Learning: Classification algorithms, model evaluation metrics
Data Visualization: For understanding feature distributions and model performance
